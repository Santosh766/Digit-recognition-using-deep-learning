# Digit-recognition-using-deep-learning
This is a deep learning model that predict the hand written digits using ANN. Here deep learning model is used with three kinds of layers that is input layer, hidden layer and output layer. 

Significant improvement in the accuracy is observed when hidden layer is applied. basically it was a non-linear classification problem that cannot be precessed without hidden layer, so hidden layer is used that is known for non-linear classification problem. 

Lastly confusion matrix is plotted where we can evaluate the model performance in graphical form.
